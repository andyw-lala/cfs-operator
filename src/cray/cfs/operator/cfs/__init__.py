    This is a urllib3.utils.Retry adapter that allows us to modify the behavior of
    what happens during retry. By overwriting the superclassed method increment, we
    can provide the user with information about how frequently we are reattempting
    an endpoint.

    Providing this feedback to the user allows us to dramatically increase the number
    of retry operations within the provided call to an attempted upstream API, and
    gives users a chance to intervene on behalf of the slower upstream service. This
    behavior is consistent with existing retry behavior that is expected by all of our
    API interactions, as well, gives us a more immediate sense of feedback for overall
    system instability and network congestion.
